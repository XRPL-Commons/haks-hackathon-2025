**Two onsite workshops will help guide you during this event by providing hands-on insights, practical tools, and expert support to develop your project.**

### Workshop 1 *(Saturday 10h30 - 11h20)*

> In the first part how to build on the XRPLedger? 
An overview of how it works, getting started, creating a wallet, and making your first transaction.

> Second part, how can blockchain be used to benefit the greatest number of people, crypto for good ?

### Workshop 2 *(Saturday 14h30 - 15h20)*

> Overview of how an AI agent works.

### Submission requirements


- A link to your repository, which must be publicly accessible.

- A short text presenting the main idea of your project: what it is about, what its objective is, and addressing the following questions:

> What real-world problem does your project aim to solve? Why is it important?

> How can your solution scale beyond the hackathon? Does it have the potential for broader adoption?

> Specify the XRPL features used. Does your project effectively leverage XRPLâ€™s blockchain capabilities?

> Estimate the potential volume of real-world transactions your solution could generate on the XRPL.

- A link to a video or screenshots showcasing your solution.

#### XRPL Network Requirements
- Build on the XRPL Testnet.
- All projects must submit transactions to the L1.
- Using a sidechain such as [Xahau](https://xahau.network/) or the [XRPL EVM Sidechain](https://docs.xrplevm.org/) is allowed, but it may cost you a few points in the final scoring.

### Judging criteria

Project evaluation will be based on four main criteria, each carrying equal weight in the final score :

- **Idea** (the originality of the concept)
- **Implementation** (the quality of the code and robustness of the architecture)
- **Demo** (how clearly you present your solution to the user)
- **Potential** (the total value transacted on-chain, the business model, and the potential to turn your project into a product)
