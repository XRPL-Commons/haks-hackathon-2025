**Welcome to the HAKS hackathon 2025 !**

</div>

**As part of this hackathon, you can choose one of the topics below and develop a project around it. Feel free to unleash your creativity and approach it in an original and meaningful way.**

### AI & Blockckchain

This track explores how artificial intelligence (IA) and blockchain can strengthen each other to create new, more powerful, transparent, and autonomous use cases.

For example, you could build projects where:

- IA makes decisions or acts autonomously, and blockchain ensures transparency, traceability, security, or coordination.

- Intelligent agents such as bots or autonomous IA can interact with each other or with the real world through a distributed ledger like XRPL.

- The origin of content generated by IA (texts, images, decisionsâ€¦) is certified on the blockchain to prevent deepfakes, ensure authenticity, or assign accountability to agents.



### Crypto for Good

This track encourages creating blockchain solutions for the greater good, financial inclusion, humanitarian aid, climate resilience, and supply chain transparency.
Here are some project examples :

- Financial Inclusion: payments, savings, and transfers accessible to the unbanked, even through SMS or WhatsApp, without the need for a smartphone or bank account.

- Humanitarian Aid: transparent, traceable donation collection and aid distribution systems powered by blockchain.

- Climate Resilience: blockchain-based climate data tracking, carbon credits, or decentralized energy projects.

- Humanitarian Supply Chain: standardization and traceability of products like RUTF bars, from manufacturing to the child beneficiary, with verifiable proof of delivery and stablecoin funding.

**A workshop will introduce you to the basics of the XRPL, including creating transactions, NFTs, and interacting with a wallet like Xaman, to help you effectively develop your project.**

### Workshop 1 *(Saturday 10h00 - 11h00)*

> In the first part how to build on the XRPLedger? 
An overview of how it works, getting started, creating a wallet, and making your first transaction.

> Second part, how can we interact with the Xaman wallet to create and sign transactions, manage NFTs, and explore real-world use cases?


---

### Submission requirements


- A link to your repository, which must be publicly accessible.

- A short text presenting the main idea of your project: what it is about, what its objective is, and addressing the following questions:

> What real-world problem does your project aim to solve? Why is it important?

> How can your solution scale beyond the hackathon? Does it have the potential for broader adoption?

> Specify the XRPL features used. Does your project effectively leverage XRPLâ€™s blockchain capabilities?

> Estimate the potential volume of real-world transactions your solution could generate on the XRPL.

- A link to a video or screenshots showcasing your solution.

#### XRPL Network Requirements
- Build on the XRPL Testnet.
- All projects must submit transactions to the L1.
- Using a sidechain such as [Xahau](https://xahau.network/) or the [XRPL EVM Sidechain](https://docs.xrplevm.org/) is allowed, but it may cost you a few points in the final scoring.

### Judging criteria

Project evaluation will be based on four main criteria, each carrying equal weight in the final score :

- **Idea** (the originality of the concept)
- **Implementation** (the quality of the code and robustness of the architecture)
- **Demo** (how clearly you present your solution to the user)
- **Potential** (the total value transacted on-chain, the business model, and the potential to turn your project into a product)
